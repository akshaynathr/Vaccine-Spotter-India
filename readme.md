# Vaccine spotter for India

Vaccine spotter is a simple tool for tracking the availability of Covid vaccines in any state in India by pincode or district code.
It uses the [api](https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2#/Appointment%20Availability%20APIs/) from COWIN site to monitor for vaccine availability and sent an immediate email :envelope: to user.
 âœ¨

## Features

- Check availability of vaccine by providing pincode or district code of your area
- Run in the terminal and monitor the vaccine availability
- Send email to email address set by user immediately when there is vaccines available
- Set age range to check availability in that range.
- Set wait time before querying again the api
